## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your machine.
- A modern web browser.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    cd portfolio
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Run the development server**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and you can view the portfolio at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:
```bash

```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build of the project in the `dist` folder.

## Project Structure

```bash

│   ├── pages/            # Main pages like Home, About, Projects
│   ├── App.jsx           # Main application component
│   ├── main.jsx          # Vite entry point

### Key Components

- **App.jsx**: The root component that ties together all sections of the portfolio.
- **Home.jsx**: The landing page with an introduction, hero section, and a call to action.
- **About.jsx**: A section that gives more information about your background, skills, and experience.
- **Projects.jsx**: Showcases your past projects with images, descriptions, and links.

### Using Framer Motion

Framer Motion is used to add smooth transitions and animations to elements. In each component, you can animate elements like so:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -50 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  {/* Your component content */}
</motion.div>
```

You can customize animations further depending on the effect you want to achieve.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for optimizing and bundling the project.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind**: For styling the layout and design. (You can use CSS modules, Sass, or any CSS-in-JS solution as preferred.)

## Customization

You can extend or modify the portfolio by:
- Adding more sections (e.g., blog, testimonials).
- Enhancing the design with more complex animations or transitions using Framer Motion.
- Integrating external APIs or services (e.g., GitHub API to fetch project data).
